# NIA
NIA is a web app that allows you to save time with movie suggestions and creates a community through watching a movie live with your friends and family.

> "Trying to figure out what movie to watch used to be so difficult! I used to spend hours trying to pick a movie on Netflix before giving up and going to bed. But with NIA, everything is so easy and interactive! I love NIA!" - Annonymous


### Version

NIA uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [**M**ongoDB]
* [**E**xpress] - fast node.js network app framework
* [**A**ngularJS]
* [**N**ode.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - Grid only!
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [jQuery] - duh
* [Passport] - Simple, unobtrusive authentication for Node.js
* [Yeoman] - Scaffolding tool for modern web apps
* [Q] - Tool for creating and composing asynchronous promises
